# Policies


| Name | Subject | Description | Severity | Action | Background |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | -------- | ------ | ---------- |
|application-prevent-updates-project|Application|This policy prevents updates to the project field after an Application is created.|medium|Audit|true|"
|check-deprecated-apis|Kubernetes APIs|Kubernetes APIs are sometimes deprecated and removed after a few releases. As a best practice, older API versions should be replaced with newer versions. This policy validates for APIs that are deprecated or scheduled for removal. Note that checking for some of these resources may require modifying the Kyverno ConfigMap to remove filters. In the validate-v1-22-removals rule, the Lease kind has been commented out due to a check for this kind having a performance penalty on Kubernetes clusters with many leases. Its enabling should be attended carefully and is not recommended on large clusters. PodSecurityPolicy is removed in v1.25 so therefore the validate-v1-25-removals rule may not completely work on 1.25+. This policy requires Kyverno v1.7.4+ to function properly.      |null|Audit|true|"
|restrict-annotations|Ingress|This policy mitigates CVE-2021-25746 by restricting `metadata.annotations` to safe values. See: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/blame/main/internal/ingress/inspector/rules.go. This issue has been fixed in NGINX Ingress v1.2.0. For NGINX Ingress version 1.0.5+ the  "annotation-value-word-blocklist" configuration setting is also recommended.  Please refer to the CVE for details.       |high|Audit|true|"
|require-requests-limits|Pod|As application workloads share cluster resources, it is important to limit resources requested and consumed by each Pod. It is recommended to require resource requests and limits per Pod, especially for memory and CPU. If a Namespace level request or limit is specified, defaults will automatically be applied to each Pod based on the LimitRange configuration. This policy validates that all containers have something specified for memory and CPU requests and memory limits.      |medium|Audit|true|"
